## VLOOKUP 

  

VLOOKUP (Vertical Lookup) is a function that searches for a value in the first column of a table and returns a value in the same row from a specified column. It's useful for looking up and retrieving data from a specific column in a table. 

  

### Example 

  

Download the example file: [vlookup.xlsx](vlookup.xlsx) 

  

### Instructions 

  

1. Open `vlookup.xlsx`. 

2. You will see a table with Product IDs, Names, and Prices. 

3. The formula `=VLOOKUP(2, A2:C5, 2, FALSE)` is used to look up Product ID 2 and return the corresponding Name, which is "Banana". 

  

### Steps 

  

1. Select the cell where you want the result to appear. 

2. Enter the VLOOKUP formula: `=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])`. 

   - `lookup_value`: The value you want to search for. 

   - `table_array`: The range of cells that contains the data. 

   - `col_index_num`: The column number in the table from which to retrieve the value. 

   - `[range_lookup]`: Optional. Specifies whether you want an exact match (FALSE) or an approximate match (TRUE). 

  

## Pivot Tables 

  

Pivot Tables are powerful tools that allow you to summarize, analyze, explore, and present large amounts of data. They help you quickly create cross-tabulations and aggregate data without changing the original dataset. 

  

### Example

4. Use the PivotTable Field List to arrange fields in the Rows, Columns, Values, and Filters areas. 

  

## Conditional Formatting 

  

Conditional Formatting allows you to apply specific formatting to cells that meet certain criteria. It's a great way to highlight important information and visualize data trends.
